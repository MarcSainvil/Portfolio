# Exercise 7: Blackboard Hints

---

### Requirement 3

Whenever the mouse is moved, there is an event fired off from the `window`.

The event type is "mousemove".

In fact, in [topic-4](../../lecture/topic-4-useEffect-examples.md) you can find an example of this in action.

---

### Requirement 5

This is mostly a `CSS` problem.

You don't have to concern yourself with conditional rendering unless you're pushing into the Optional Tasks

Some `CSS` properties that may help you with the location of the tracker:

`position: absolute`

`left`

`right`

`transform: translate()`

`margin`

---

### Requirement 6

This can be tricky, or completely trivial if you complete Optional Task 8.

When you move the tracker around, it is probably being positioned on top of the "Back" `Link`.

One way to combat layering is with `z-index`. Just make sure it is not a statically positioned element, or `z-index` won't have an effect.

---

### Optional Task 7

There is a risk when using an `<img>` element: image elements are void elements.  This means they can't be parents.

So you're probably better off setting a `background-image` with `CSS`, otherwise you can't put a tracker inside this.

---

### Optional Task 8

The easiest way to hide a child from extending beyond a parent is with `overflow: hidden`.

Just make sure the tracker is actually a child of the board.

---

### Optional Task 9

Exercise 6's Optional Step 5.4 can help you.

---

### Optional Task 10

You'll probably need a new state if you want to manage conditional rendering.

Whenever the mouse moves you can set `showing` to `true` and make a timeout to set it to `false`. Each time the mouse is moved, clear the previous timeout. This can be tricky, good luck!
